         <b>>Lone Pine, California</b> is a small town in Inyo County, which is located at the southern
             end of the Sierra Nevada mountain range in the Western United States. The town has a very
             small population of 2035 (taken by 2010 census), and is found in the Owens Valley, which
             straddles the Inyo Mountains to the east and the Sierra Nevadas to the west. Since Lone Pine
             is at an elevation 1.136 kilometers, it experiences temperatures colder than do most other
             towns in Southern California.
